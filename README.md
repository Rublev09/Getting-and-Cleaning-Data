Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.


In this repo there are:

1. CodeBook.md, that describes the variables and the datasets considered in the analysis.

2. run_analysis.R, that contains all the code to perform the analysis required. 

3. averages_data.txt, that is the final output.
