The R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following step as required:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The steps to clean up the data are described, in detail, in run_analysis.R.

    x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contains the data from the downloaded files.
    x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets.
    features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset.
    activities contains the correct names for the activity names.
    total_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a unique dataset.
    averages_data contains the final output.
